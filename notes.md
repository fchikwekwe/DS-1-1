Q. What is Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and what is Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)?

A. Both are approaches to approximate histogram.  
- GMM - K = 2, we use two normal distribution to approximate histogram of data samples
- KDE - Each data sample would be one mean for the N number of data samples we have; all data samples have the same variance; KDE generally has better approximation

Q. Which one of GMM and KDE has more normal components?
- KDE would have more normal components
