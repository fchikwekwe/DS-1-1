## What is Null Hypothesis - Real Life & In Industry (10 min)

Think about a raindance, or superstition in general. Why did people believe the witchdoctor could call the rain?

**Null Hypothesis** is the formal methods of reaching conclusions based on population statistics and sample data where
we apply changes to population

Industry uses
* Drug test on response time of brain
* A special food boost IQ
* A/B Marketing Test


## Learning Objectives (Competencies) (5 min)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Describe null hypothesis and when and how apply Null Hypothesis
2. What are the metrics we need in order to statistically accept or reject null  
3. How and when use Z test or T test
4. Whether or not two samples are different

## Activity: Reviewing Standard Normal (10 min)

Instructions

Reminder for Z distribution, and ask student to verify Z distribution is standard normal, CDF and survival function review (10 min)

## Activity: Identifying and Generating Null Hypotheses (10 min)

Look at the following table of hypotheses and corresponding null hypotheses. Work with a partner to fill in the blanks. Be ready to share to the whole class.

| HYPOTHESIS | NULL HYPOTHESIS |
|----------|:-------------:    |
| col 1 is |  left-aligned.    |
| col 2 is |    centered       |
| col 3 is | right-aligned     |
| col 3 is |      |
| col 3 is | right-aligned     |
|  | right-aligned     |
| col 3 is |      |


## Null Hypothesis Drug Example & Calculating p-value from z-score (25 Min)

- TT: what is null Hypothesis by mentioning drug effect example what is z-score? (20 min)

Errors can happen when accepting ...
- TT: When use Z test and T test (5 min)
You can also do more with these tests ... 
- TT: What is one-tail or two-tail calculation for p-value? (5 min)

## Break (10 min)

## Challenge #1-3: Mean Population (25 min)

1. Write a function the takes the mean of population, significant level and the samples as the input argument then decide to reject or accept the null hypothesis
1. Calculate t-score from its definition and compare it to the methods available in stats module in scipy
1. Write a function that determine whether use z-score or t-test in order to accept or reject null Hypothesis
1. Link to challenges in [Jupyter notebooks](../Notebooks/HypothesisTesting.ipynb)

As a stretch challenge [apply null hypothesis to these problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ITryiXU_VoyBvtZY4deehk4PmlieSlF7rSNc8sBU3Sw/edit)
